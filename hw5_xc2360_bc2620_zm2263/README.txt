We provided rrt.py fo single directional search and bi_rrt.py for bi-directional search.

Remember you need to install "pygame" UI library before running; the command is "pip install pygame",
then simply run "python rrt.py" and wait for a few seconds to let graph render. The python version we 
are using is 2.7.12.

Currently we try 100000 attempts before it concludes the goal cannot reach.
