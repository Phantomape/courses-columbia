# COMS4733-Robotics

##  Guideline
* Work on your own branch. For each feature or bug fix, it should create a branch before submitting a patch or pull request. Any request to master or develop will be rejected in the future.
* Branch should follow a naming rule. It should be named as feature/YOUR_FEATURE_NAME or bugfix/YOUR_BUG_NAME.
* Always base on latest develop branch. Use "git pull --rebase" to rewind your changes on top of develop.
* Amend your commit. Prefer merge all your commits into one for one feature or bug fix. (git reset --soft "HEAD^", git commit --amend)
